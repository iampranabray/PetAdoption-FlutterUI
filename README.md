# Pet Adoption

This is a pet adoption app built with Flutter that allows users to browse and adopt pets. It includes pagination listing, search functionality, and a history of adoption feature.

## Features

- Pagination listing: The app fetches and displays a list of pets in a paginated manner, allowing users to browse through multiple pages of available pets.

- Search: Users can search for pets based on different criteria such as name age, gender, etc. The app provides a search bar where users can enter their search query and receive filtered results.

- History of adoption: The app keeps track of pets that users have adopted in the past. It provides a history section where users can view the details of previously adopted pets.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following famous dependencies:

- [flutter_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc): State management library that provides a predictable way to manage app state.
- [isar](https://pub.dev/packages/isar): Super Fast Cross-Platform Database for Flutter
- [provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider): State management library that provides a predictable way to manage app state.
- [get_it](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it): This is a simple Service Locator for Dart and Flutter projects with some additional goodies highly inspired by Splat. It can be used instead of InheritedWidget or Provider to access objects e.g. from your UI.
